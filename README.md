# First day <br />
I tried to make a docker-compose.yml which is supposed to create my 3 services:
- web (front-end)
- api (cSharp API)
- mariadb (database)

I managed to make working containers for web and mariadb, but I'm struggling with the C# container...

# Day 2 <br />
I imported my .NET API and dockerized it. <br />
But for some reasons, when I execute my container, I have my access denied with an error 500...
