#First day
I tried to make a docker-compose.yml which is supposed to create my 3 services:
- web (front-end)
- api (cSharp API)
- mariadb (database)

I managed to make working containers for web and mariadb, but I'm struggling with the C# container...

#Day 2
I imported my .NET API and dockerize it. But for some reasons, when I execute my container, I have my access denied with an error 500...
